    "text": "Power BI Dashboard\n\n\n\nDescription\nThis project focuses on creating a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard to analyse the sales and profitability performance of a superstore. By leveraging business intelligence and data analytics, this dashboard provides actionable insights that help improve decision-making across different aspects of the business, including sales performance, profit margins, customer behaviour, and regional trends.\nThe dashboard allows users to explore key metrics such as total revenue, total profit, number of orders, and discount trends, while also breaking down sales and profitability at a category, sub-category, and regional level. With interactive visualisations and filters, this project helps businesses identify growth opportunities, optimise pricing strategies, and enhance operational efficiency.\n\n\nData used for dashboard\n\n\nReveal code\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# load csv file\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"data/Superstore.csv\", encoding=\"latin1\", sep=\";\")\n\n# Show first 5 rows\ndf.head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRow ID\nOrder ID\nOrder Date\nShip Date\nShip Mode\nCustomer ID\nCustomer Name\nSegment\nCountry\nCity\n...\nPostal Code\nRegion\nProduct ID\nCategory\nSub-Category\nProduct Name\nSales\nQuantity\nDiscount\nProfit\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\nCA-2013-152156\n09/11/2013\n12/11/2013\nSecond Class\nCG-12520\nClaire Gute\nConsumer\nUnited States\nHenderson\n...\n42420\nSouth\nFUR-BO-10001798\nFurniture\nBookcases\nBush Somerset Collection Bookcase\n261.96\n2.0\n0.00\n$419.136,00\n\n\n1\n2\nCA-2013-152156\n09/11/2013\n12/11/2013\nSecond Class\nCG-12520\nClaire Gute\nConsumer\nUnited States\nHenderson\n...\n42420\nSouth\nFUR-CH-10000454\nFurniture\nChairs\nHon Deluxe Fabric Upholstered Stacking Chairs,...\n731.94\n3.0\n0.00\n$219.582,00\n\n\n2\n3\nCA-2013-138688\n13/06/2013\n17/06/2013\nSecond Class\nDV-13045\nDarrin Van Huff\nCorporate\nUnited States\nLos Angeles\n...\n90036\nWest\nOFF-LA-10000240\nOffice Supplies\nLabels\nSelf-Adhesive Address Labels for Typewriters b...\n14.62\n2.0\n0.00\n$68.714,00\n\n\n3\n4\nUS-2012-108966\n11/10/2012\n18/10/2012\nStandard Class\nSO-20335\nSean O'Donnell\nConsumer\nUnited States\nFort Lauderdale\n...\n33311\nSouth\nFUR-TA-10000577\nFurniture\nTables\nBretford CR4500 Series Slim Rectangular Table\n$9.575.775,00\n5.0\n0.45\n$-383.031,00\n\n\n4\n5\nUS-2012-108966\n11/10/2012\n18/10/2012\nStandard Class\nSO-20335\nSean O'Donnell\nConsumer\nUnited States\nFort Lauderdale\n...\n33311\nSouth\nOFF-ST-10000760\nOffice Supplies\nStorage\nEldon Fold 'N Roll Cart System\n$22.368,00\n2.0\n0.20\n$25.164,00\n\n\n\n\n5 rows × 21 columns\n\n\n\n View project artefacts"
