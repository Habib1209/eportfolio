Through this project it has become all to aware the benefits of using a version control software like git. It made it very useful for me to track changes, seperate changes logically and undo mistakes. I also enjoyed learning how to use quarto. It is amazing how you can use markdown to create visulations in python. Git and quarto will definitely be of benefit to me in my goal to contribute to and lead projects that leverage big data to drive innovation, optimise processes, and enhance decision-making."

By leveraging business intelligence and data analytics, this dashboard provides actionable insights that help improve decision-making across different aspects of the business, including sales performance, profit margins, customer behaviour, and regional trends.\nThe dashboard allows users to explore key metrics such as total revenue, total profit, number of orders, and discount trends, while also breaking down sales and profitability at a category, sub-category, and regional level.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Description\nThis project focuses on optimising the overbooking strategy for Green Airways, a regional airline operating three daily flights from Dublin to London, each with a capacity of 100 passengers. The airline aims to maximise profitability by compensating for passenger no-shows through a data-driven overbooking approach. Using Excel, I analysed historical booking and check-in data to identify trends in no-shows and demand fluctuations, employing pivot tables and functions to summarise key patterns.\nI then built financial models to assess the impact of overbooking by 1 to 5 passengers per flight, utilising Excel’s scenario modelling and What-If Analysis tools to evaluate the effects on profitability, considering revenue gains and compensation costs. Finally, I applied Monte Carlo simulations to test various overbooking strategies over 500 days, running multiple iterations to assess risks and determine the most profitable approach.\n\n\n\nProject Excel Sheet\n\n\nView project artefacts"

This project highlights my ability to work with raw data, perform data cleaning and transformation, and design an efficient relational database structure.\nTo achieve this, I imported the datasets into a SQL environment, ensuring data integrity by defining appropriate primary and foreign keys and establishing relationships between tables.
