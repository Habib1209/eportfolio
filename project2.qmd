### Description
This project focuses on optimising the overbooking strategy for Green Airways, a regional airline operating three daily flights from Dublin to London, each with a capacity of 100 passengers. The airline aims to maximise profitability by compensating for passenger no-shows through a data-driven overbooking approach. Using Excel, I analysed historical booking and check-in data to identify trends in no-shows and demand fluctuations, employing pivot tables and functions to summarise key patterns.

I then built financial models to assess the impact of overbooking by 1 to 5 passengers per flight, utilising Excelâ€™s scenario modelling and What-If Analysis tools to evaluate the effects on profitability, considering revenue gains and compensation costs. Finally, I applied Monte Carlo simulations to test various overbooking strategies over 500 days, running multiple iterations to assess risks and determine the most profitable approach.
